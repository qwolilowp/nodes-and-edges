It is network sequencer, a AI supported sequencer, a aleatoric-nonaleatoric sequencer, a drawing music notation or experimental notation. It is a straight forward new resembling of the idea of the UPIC (Unité Polyagogique Informatique du CEMAMu (Centre d'Etudes de Mathématique et Automatique Musicales), also take a look at Iannis Xenakis post mortem page http://www.iannis-xenakis.org/xen/bio/biography.html) as far as we understand it. To get deeper into the point of viewing music take a look into his work *Formalized music* https://monoskop.org/images/7/74/Xenakis_Iannis_Formalized_Music_Thought_and_Mathematics_in_Composition.pdf

We are not interested in formalizing music. We are up to network sequencing and complex eventing through this, also to the transformation of drawings into musical control values. We attribute this aleatoric-nonaleatoric, because we do not use chance as a basis for a algorithmic music, but a algorithm to extract control values from drawings. That is more or less a case of serendipity, you can expect certain results, but the results are not fully predictable, but not randomly.
