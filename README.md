## WHAT IS IT
It is a network sequencer, a AI supported sequencer, a aleatoric-nonaleatoric sequencer, a drawing music notation or experimental notation, a midi sequencer and a audio-data sequencer. 

The sequencing is done by arranging nodes (audio/midi/notation events) with edges between each other. The edges just pass the activity around and the nodes are active or not and release activity.

## THE NODES

### MUSIC NOTATION NODE

The muic notation node is not finished now.It is a straight forward new resembling of the idea of the UPIC (Unité Polyagogique Informatique du CEMAMu (Centre d'Etudes de Mathématique et Automatique Musicales), also take a look at Iannis Xenakis post mortem page http://www.iannis-xenakis.org/xen/bio/biography.html) as far as we understand it. To get deeper into the point of viewing music take a look into his work *Formalized music* https://monoskop.org/images/7/74/Xenakis_Iannis_Formalized_Music_Thought_and_Mathematics_in_Composition.pdf

We are not interested in formalizing music. We are up to network sequencing and complex eventing through this, also to the transformation of drawings into musical control values. We attribute this aleatoric-nonaleatoric, because we do not use chance as a basis for a algorithmic music, but a algorithm to extract control values from drawings. That is more or less a case of serendipity, you can expect certain results, but the results are not fully predictable, but not randomly.
